* Experimental custom selectors

* Use dictionaries for custom aliases and increase test coverage to 100%

* Rework identifiers to behave more appropriate
According to CSS spec, you can't have an identifier that is just `-`.
Also restrict custom pseudo class to starting with `--`.

* Refactor aliases
Use an object so that we can possibly expand functionality in the future
if desired. Also only compile aliases when we are compiling the actual
selector so we can properly associate the current flags with and
compiled aliases with each other.

Ensure that all HTML specific selectors are comparing all related
elements against the XHTML namespace. In HTML parsers that do not
provide an HTML namespace for HTML elements, assume XHTML namespace.

Ensure that :root, :contains(), :lang(), :dir(), :default, and :indeterminate all consider
iframe boundaries and do not evaluate parent or child documents when
determining whether an element matches or not.

When a scoped selector is part of an iframe, :root should match that
scoped element's document root, and not the root of the whle tree.
