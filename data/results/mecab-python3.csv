SWIG creates both a C extension module _MeCab.so and a Python wrapper
MeCab.py from MeCab.i.  These must both be installed alongside each
other, or `import MeCab` won’t work.  However, by default distutils
runs `build_py` (which is the step that copies MeCab.py from the
source directory to its staging location) before `build_ext` (which is
the step that actually invokes SWIG).

The cure is to monkey-patch `build_py` to run `build_ext` before doing
anything else.

There are two reasons for this change.  Most important, the SWIG
definitions we ship are copied out of the MeCab library’s source tree

This makes clear which version of those definitions we have.

Also, Debian already ships a version of these bindings that are
numbered mostly consistently with the MeCab library (python-mecab,
currently version 0.99.6-2) but are stuck without Python 3 support.
