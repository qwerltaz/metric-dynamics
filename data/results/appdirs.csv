When packaging appdirs and pip (which bundles it) in Fedora, we have realized
that there is a nonexecuatble file with a shebang line.

It seems that the primary purpose of this file is to be imported from Python
code or to be executed via `python appdirs.py` or `python -m
appdirs` and hence the shebang appears to be unnecessary.

Shebangs are hard to handle when doing downstream packaging, because it makes
sense for upstream to use `#!/usr/bin/env python` while in the RPM package, we
need to avoid that and use a more specific interpreter. Since the shebang was
unused, I propose to remove it to avoid the problems.",False,1,0,1,,,,709,333,386,32,4.04,69.59310475164467,23.0,34.5,201.3908149762557,1.6985294117647058,1003.9454877165531,55.77474931758628,0.0671302716587519
