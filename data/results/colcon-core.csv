* Always prepend with a trailing separator

This resolves an issue where environment variables can collid if modified by both .dsv files and scripts.
For more detail see https://github.com/ament/ament_package/issues/103

The solution is to always prepend, which will avoid overwriting a variable if previously set by a script.
Then we introduce a cleanup command for each variable prepended to in order to remove a possible trailing separator.

I think it is acceptable to catch a generic Exception in both
places where the error is being reported.

In the command.py, we could use the exception type
`warnings._OptionError`, but I don't think it's safe to rely this
private exception type as it might not remain stable in future.
It would be better to not call the private function altogether,
but I'm not sure how best to avoid it.

In executor/__init__.py, we are propagating the exception in the
except block. In this case, I consider the linter is reporting a
false-positive, as it is unable to handle this situation.

dependencies from the setuptools options when processing ament_python

seeing `python3-pytest` in the test dependency list, the pure python
code here looks for the pure python dependency `pytest`.

needed, I'll take the same approach in the Python project code as was
