Previously, special files were treated almost exactly like normal
files, but they have several distinctions. Most of them are either
non-seekable, or practically non-seekable. Treating those which
were practically non-seekable (e.g. /dev/null) as seekable didn't
result in errors, but other special files such as FIFO's would
fail on seek. Further, most special files actually keep the data
in memory on write, and so need to be handled differently.

To work around those edge cases, all special files are treated as
non-seekable, in-memory files.

This adds a similar fix to the ctrl-c download test where we
measure the time from when we ctrl-c to when it exits, which is
what we really want to test.

I also updated the tests to run quicker.  An earlier commit
switched the object_exists call to use a waiter, but did not
verify the slower runtime of the tests in the negative case.
Rather than wait for the waiter to timeout, I've added an

The two main changes are:
* Update the CRT S3 client factory to accept a CRT credential
  provider instead of a botocore credential provider. Under the
  hood, the S3 client only accepts a CRT credential provider. So,
  this provides more flexibility in being able to provide other
  CRT credenital providers directly instead of being forced to
  the botocore credential provider interface
* Update the botocore to CRT credentials adapter interface to
  only accept botocore credential objects instead of credential
  providers. In general, the credentials object is more accessible
  than the provider; it can be retrieved at the session level and
  is what is passed into clients. Also, this change avoids
  a limitation where the load_credentials() method on the
  credential provider cannot be called more than twice for some
  configurations (e.g. assume role from profile), which can be
  an issue if you create both a botocore client and CRT S3 client.",False,174,100,74,0.1111111111111111,1.0,0.8888888888888888,22201,10586,14899,2066,1.5084477296726504,64.72509727644209,24.03125,37.484375,205.5036722237709,2.7847838913590257,1187.327789501792,65.96265497232179,0.0685012240745903

This gives a 24% speedup when downloading a folder with 30,000 small files using the CRT via CLI.

When profiling this workload, `_validate_subscriber_methods()` had a big presence in the flame graph. Commenting out the validate function gave a huge speedup. But the validation is useful, so we didn't want to remove it. Using lru_cache provides the same speedup for the 30,000 file workload. It runs 6 times (once per subscriber class) instead of 180,000 times (6 times per file).",False,3,3,0,,,,22452,10694,15111,2076,1.5136268343815513,64.58397274247702,24.421875,38.0,209.36901311857366,2.8066772177247103,1224.0619707468998,68.00344281927222,0.06978967103952458
