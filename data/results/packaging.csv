The original specifier code assumed that the only kind of specifiers
that would ever be in play are PEP 440 compliant specifiers. However
it quickly came to light that there are a lot of legacy cases where
a specifier cannot be cleanly parsed using PEP 440.

This changes the specifier handling code to have:

* An abstract base class, ``BaseSpecifier`` which functions as the
  definition for what a specifier class must contain.
* A ``LegacySpecifier`` which interprets all versions as a
  ``LegacyVersion``. This does not implement any of the new operator
  types such as ``~=`` or ``===`` and is intended to act like
  setuptools previously did.
* A ``Specifier`` which interprets specifiers as defined in PEP 440.
* A ``SpecifierSet`` which can hold one or more specifiers and
  attempts to sanely allow the mixed usage of both ``Specifier`` and
  ``LegacySpecifier``.

A major change in behavior is that a ``Specifier`` (and now a
``LegacySpecifier``) will only represent one single specifier and will
not accept a comma separated list of them. The new ``SpecifierSet``
will handle cases where you have one or more specifiers and will
attempt to sanely handle the case where you have a mixture of
``Specifier`` and ``LegacySpecifier`` instances.

In particular, a ``SpecifierSet`` has the following behaviors:

If given no specifiers:

* It will *not* match any ``LegacyVersion`` items.
* It will *not* match any pre-release versions, unless there are no
  final releases available that match.

If given any specifiers:

* It will match only if the given version(s) match each and every
  specifier contained within the ``Specifier`` set.

The side effects of this are:

* If two specifiers are given, one that matches pre-releases and one
  that doesn't, then the ``SpecifierSet`` as a whole will not accept
  any pre-releases.
* Even versions that can be parsed as PEP 440 will not use any of the
  new semantics when being interpreted by a ``LegacySpecifier``, so
  something like ``SpecifierSet("">=1.0-1-1"")`` will end up allowing
  pre-releases since ``LegacyVersion`` has no concept of them.",False,1221,930,291,0.6742081447963801,0.8778280542986425,0.4886877828054298,3286,951,2315,531,2.0228571428571427,78.3392192859727,27.066666666666663,49.13333333333333,304.50413432579654,2.871837087322491,2593.2572873480885,144.069849297116,0.1015013781085988

This ensures that an `re.match` or `re.search` does not exclude the
wildcard in cases where it would otherwise match. Without this
reordering, a regex match of a wildcard specifier would only match the
version sections before it since both parts of the prior part of the
unnamed group are optional, allowing the group to match an empty string
even though it is optional as a whole.

This does not affect `Specifier` since the regex used by it gets a `$`
added to it, forcing the regular expression engine to backtrack in such
cases. It does, however, affect `Requirement` since it is currently
allowing these values through since they match the regex for
`LegacySpecifier`.

Since `LegacyVersion` is no longer a thing, this check is no longer

* Reorder `Specifier` regex groups to check wildcard matches early

This ensures that an `re.match` or `re.search` does not exclude the
wildcard in cases where it would otherwise match. Without this
reordering, a regex match of a wildcard specifier would only match the
version sections before it since both parts of the prior part of the
unnamed group are optional, allowing the group to match an empty string
even though it is optional as a whole.

This does not affect `Specifier` since the regex used by it gets a `$`
added to it, forcing the regular expression engine to backtrack in such
cases. It does, however, affect `Requirement` since it is currently
allowing these values through since they match the regex for
`LegacySpecifier`.

* Stop accepting legacy specifiers in `Requirement`

* Remove `LegacySpecifier` class

This class has been deprecated for multiple releases now.

* Remove `LegacyVersion` class

This class has been deprecated for multiple releases now.

* Merge `_IndividualSpecifier` and `Specifier`

This also eliminates the `_IndividualSpecifier.prereleases`, which is
no longer used.

* Drop `_require_version_compare`

This enforced that a `LegacyVersion` could not match a `Specifier`.
Since `LegacyVersion` is no longer a thing, this check is no longer
necessary.

* Factor out `_coerce_version` and use it to simplify a loop

This makes the loop easier to understand.
