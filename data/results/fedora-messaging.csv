52,1c1473d5c169bf184937991b9f11ce5d16282a97,Jeremy Cline,2018-07-24 20:32:35+00:00,"Add 100% test coverage to the config module and fix issues

Adds test coverage to the config module and modifies a few behaviors
based on it. ``pop`` calls result an exception, as keys should be
removed from the configuration. The default logging was still getting
set up early, so that's been removed so apps and the CLI can set it up
as they wish.

``load`` was placed in the LazyConfig class since there was no real
reason for it to be on its own.

``_validate`` was added to LazyConfig and is called at load time. If
validation fails, a ConfigurationException is raised. At this time it
asserts there are no extra keys in the configuration and enforces the
client properties (or resets them if the user specified just the app
name).

This combines the _queues set with the _consumers dictionary and uses a
new representation that includes the consumer tag, the queue for the
consumer, and the callback to be invoked when a message arrives. This
offers several advantages:

* Creating our own consumer tag rather than waiting for the server to
  create one for us, we can register consumers and return references to
  callers without actually calling out to the server. This will be used in
  the future with a ``consume`` and ``cancel`` API that doesn't require
  ``resumeProducing`` to be called first.

* Allows for Twisted users to have different callbacks for different
  consumers without starting one service per callback.

This is a prep-work commit and doesn't change the behavior of the
Twisted protocol.

There were two issues with the TLS connection which I discovered when
adding the test:

* On Python 2, the hostname needs to be Unicode text.

* The second is that in Python 3, we were opening the CA cert bundle as
  text, which Twisted would try to re-encode to bytes using ASCII.
  Fedora's CA bundle has a comment with some text that can't be encoded
  as ASCII, so it explodes. The solution is to just open the file in
  bytes mode.

The command-line flags on the consume command are intended to make it
quick and easy to run simple consumers without fiddling with a
configuration file.

To this end, allow users to override --exchange, --queue-name, and
--routing-key, rather than requiring none or all. This brings it in line
with the manual page which states defaults for queue-name and exchange
will be used if they are not provided.

This implementation is simplistic in that it sets all bindings in the
configuration to be for the provided values. However, the command line
interface options do not offer a way exactly declare exchanges, queues,
and bindings (durability options, arbitrary arguments, etc) so the
documentation is updated to indicate for complex queue configurations,
the configuration file should be used instead of command-line arguments.

provides a way for users to start AMQP consumers that run until
explicitly canceled or until a fatal error occurs on the broker.

This introduces new versions of the Protocol, Factory, and Service
classes as the APIs of these Twisted classes had to change. The original
classes have been deprecated and will be removed in fedora-messaging
v2.0.0.

One thing to note is that these new classes use the standard library's
logging module. While it is true that these are blocking calls which may
use the network and happen in the reactor thread, it makes configuring
logging for consumers much easier.

There are a number of cases which weren't being properly handled on the
less-than-happy path:

1. If the user had no access to the vhost at all, it would endlessly
   reconnect without any indication of a problem.

2. If authentication failed, it would do the same thing as 1.

3. If the user had access to the vhost, but lacked read permissions, it
   would set up the queue, configure the subscriber, and then would fail
   to read from the queue. The channel would be closed and it would
   assume it was a connection problem, but the connection was fine. The
   consumer would just hang.

For 1 and 2, a ConnectionException is now raised by ``twisted_consume``
as the connection is not going to improve with more retries.

For 3, a new exception has been added, PermissionException (of which
BadDeclaration is now a subclass), which is provided to the
consumer.result errback when there's a permission problem. This gives
the API users an opportunity to do something about it.

Case 3 is not properly handled by Pika 1.0.0b1 and b2 and its test is
skipped in that case. The 403 is never passed back to the reader of the
queue. We need to fix this upstream.

This introduces crochet[0], a small library designed to make it easy to
provide synchronous APIs using asynchronous Twisted APIs. This modifies
the `fedora_messaging.api.consume` and `fedora_messaging.api.publish`
calls to use the Twisted protocol.

There are several advantages here:

1. The synchronous and asynchronous APIs use the same code which means
   there's fewer opportunities for them to differ in behavior and less
   code to maintain.

2. Both APIs didn't really work well because they could not heartbeat in
   the background. This lets them do so because the connection is
   handled in Twisted in a separate crochet-managed thread. While the
   performance improvements are likely modest, it won't lead to so many
   TCP connections being killed by firewalls or the broker.

The downside is it introduces the complexity of threads to the API which
makes it less obvious what is going on.

There are a few minor changes here which slightly change the APIs:

1. Publishing now raises a PublishTimeout when the timeout is reached
   (30 seconds by default).

2. Previously, the Twisted consume API did not validate arguments like
   the synchronous version did, so it now raises a ValueError on invalid
   arguments instead of crashing in some undefined way.

3. Calling publish from the Twisted reactor thread now raises an
   exception instead of blocking the reactor thread.

Although all these are small changes, I think this should be in a 2.0
release. In practice I don't think any of these issues will bite anyone
so upgrading shouldn't be a problem for anyone.

This does not move the CLI back to the synchronous API (yet).

collect test fixtures, but can also be chained together with other
commands using pipes. Messages are written as they arrive, one message
per line, so it's easy to, say, run a command when a message arrives:

$ fedora-messaging record - | while read -r line || -n $line;
    do echo ""message received""; done

or create a quick (and completely unreliable) bridge between brokers:

$ fedora-messaging --conf=broker1.toml record - | \

connection but rather on all consumers in the channel. There is no way
to have connection-wide limits with RabbitMQ.

Since we create a new channel for each consumer, we must set the QoS in
this channel and not in the main channel, otherwise it'll always be
limitless.

pytest re-writes the assert method to be able to provide a much more
detailed output to the user explaining why a certain assertion failed.
This is really handy when debugging failing tests.

With this commits, we are telling pytest to rewrite the assert used
in the fedora_messaging.testing module so it returns more information
to the user.

Without this commit the error message looks like:
````
>               assert msg == expected
E               AssertionError
````

With this change, the error looks like:
````
E               AssertionError: assert PullRequestFlagAddedV1(id='1a07142d-f730-41ef-b1ee-2881b37c7b03', topic='pagure.pull-request.flag.added', body={'pullr...updated': '1604049807', 'user': {'name': 'pingou', 'fullname': 'PY C', 'url_path': 'user/pingou'}}, 'agent': 'pingou'}) == PullRequestFlagAddedV1(id='4a6a4d00-937d-4e7f-9f6d-192c29d5aad9', topic='pagure.pull-request.flag.added', body={'pullr... 'date_updated': <ANY>, 'user': {'name': 'pingou', 'fullname': 'PY C', 'url_path': 'user/pingou'}}, 'agent': 'pingou'})
````

Adding the -v or -vv flag to pytest will increate the proportion of
the messages shown, but will not clearly show the difference between
the messages.

This makes it easier to debug what is failing in a test suite.
Was it the topic? The dict sent? Or something else in the object?

This together with the previous commit allowing to use the re-written
assertion from pytest makes it much easier to find out why a specific
assertion failed.

Without this commit the error message looks like:
````

````

Adding the -v or -vv flag will only show more of the messages without
pointing out where the messages differ.

With this change, the error looks like:
````

And with the -v option passed to pytest:

```

Ie: the dict are showned and diffed instead of the objects which makes
pytest point out exactly where the messages differ.
